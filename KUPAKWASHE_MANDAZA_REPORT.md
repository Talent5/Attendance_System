## Chapter 1: Introduction to the "AttendPro" QR Code-Based Workplace Attendance System

### 1.1 Introduction
The Ministry of ICT, Innovation, Postal and Courier Services in Zimbabwe is the central authority responsible for formulating and implementing national policies on information and communication technologies (ICTs), postal services, and innovation. Its mandate includes driving digital transformation to modernize public sector operations and integrate emerging technologies across the economy (Ministry of ICT, Innovation, Postal and Courier Services, 2023). Internally, the Ministry must exemplify the digital efficiency it promotes, making the optimization of its operational processes both symbolic and functional. However, during my internship, I observed that the Ministry's employee attendance system relied on outdated, paper-based methods, which were inefficient and prone to errors. This observation aligns with broader challenges in Zimbabwe's public sector, where digital transformation potential remains underutilized despite advancements in digital payments (World Bank, 2021).

To address this gap, I contributed to the development of the "AttendPro" QR Code-Based Workplace Attendance System. This project aimed to replace manual attendance registers with a digital solution leveraging QR code technology to streamline tracking, enhance accuracy, and align with the Ministry's digital transformation goals. The system draws inspiration from similar QR code-based attendance systems in academic literature, which have demonstrated improved efficiency in educational settings (Masalha & Hirzallah, 2014; Patel et al., 2019). The internship provided hands-on experience in applying information systems principles to solve real-world challenges, contributing to both organizational efficiency and academic discourse on public sector digitalization.

### 1.2 Problems Identified
The manual attendance system at the Ministry presented several critical issues, consistent with challenges documented in both industry and academic literature on traditional attendance methods (IceHRM, 2020; Automated Attendance Management Systems: Systematic Literature Review, 2024). These issues included:

- **Long Queues:** Employees experienced delays during peak sign-in and sign-out times, reducing productivity and disrupting workflows.
- **Proxy Attendance:** The paper-based system was susceptible to unauthorized sign-ins, a common problem known as "buddy punching" (truMe, 2022).
- **Illegible Records:** Handwritten logs were often incomplete or difficult to read, leading to errors in record-keeping.
- **Administrative Burden:** Compiling and analyzing attendance data manually was time-consuming and error-prone, placing a significant burden on human resources staff (Advance Systems Ireland, 2016).
- **Limited Reporting:** The lack of digital tools hindered timely report generation and trend analysis, limiting the system's utility for decision-making and performance monitoring.

These challenges are not unique to the Ministry but reflect broader issues with manual attendance systems in public sector organizations. For instance, studies highlight that manual systems are prone to time theft, human error, and inefficiencies, particularly in large organizations where accurate data collection is critical for payroll and compliance (Automated Attendance Management Systems: Systematic Literature Review, 2024; Advance Systems Ireland, 2016).

### 1.3 System Requirements

3. The backend validates the QR code and logs the attendance event.
4. The admin portal retrieves data for real-time dashboards and reports.

**Data Science Application:** This interaction model supports a data pipeline from collection to visualization, enabling descriptive and predictive analytics (Provost and Fawcett, 2013).

### 4.4 Key Features

#### 4.4.1 Dynamic QR Code Generation
QR codes are generated dynamically for each employee with unique identifiers to prevent reuse and fraud, a standard practice in QR code-based systems (Masalha and Hirzallah, 2014).

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// QR Code Generation Function
const generateEmployeeQR = async (employeeId) => {
  const employee = await Employee.findById(employeeId);
  
  const qrData = {
    employeeId: employee.employeeId,
    name: `${employee.firstName} ${employee.lastName}`,
    department: employee.department,
    position: employee.position,
    company: "Ministry of ICT",
    issued: new Date().toISOString(),
    expires: new Date(Date.now() + 365*24*60*60*1000).toISOString(), // 1 year
    version: "1.0",
    hash: crypto.createHash('sha256')
      .update(employee.employeeId + process.env.QR_SECRET)
      .digest('hex')
  };
  
  // Generate QR code image
  const qrCodeImage = await QRCode.toDataURL(JSON.stringify(qrData));
  
  // Save to employee record
  employee.qrCode = `QR-${employee.employeeId}-${Date.now()}`;
  employee.qrCodeData = JSON.stringify(qrData);
  await employee.save();
  
  return qrCodeImage;
};
```

**Security Features:**
- SHA-256 hash for tamper detection
- Expiration date validation
- Version control for format updates
- Unique identifier per generation
- Secret key signature

---
**📸 INSERT FIGURE 4.12: QR Code Generation Interface**
*Screenshot of the QR code generation page with preview and download options*

---

**Data Science Application:** Generates structured, time-stamped data for temporal analysis and anomaly detection. Each QR scan creates a data point with precise timing for pattern recognition.

#### 4.4.2 Offline Functionality
The mobile app captures and stores data locally when offline, automatically syncing when connection is restored, crucial for environments with poor connectivity (World Bank, 2021).

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Offline Storage with AsyncStorage
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import NetInfo from '@react-native-community/netinfo';

const scanAttendance = async (qrData) => {
  const scanRecord = {
    ...qrData,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    syncStatus: 'pending',
    id: Date.now().toString()
  };
  
  // Check network status
  const netInfo = await NetInfo.fetch();
  
  if (netInfo.isConnected) {
    // Online: Send immediately
    try {
      await api.post('/attendance/scan', scanRecord);
      scanRecord.syncStatus = 'synced';
    } catch (error) {
      // Failed: Store for later
      await storeOffline(scanRecord);
    }
  } else {
    // Offline: Store locally
    await storeOffline(scanRecord);
  }
};

const storeOffline = async (record) => {
  const pending = await AsyncStorage.getItem('pendingScans') || '[]';
  const scans = JSON.parse(pending);
  scans.push(record);
  await AsyncStorage.setItem('pendingScans', JSON.stringify(scans));
};

// Auto-sync when connection restored
NetInfo.addEventListener(state => {
  if (state.isConnected) {
    syncPendingScans();
  }
});
```

**Data Science Application:** Ensures continuous data collection, maintaining dataset completeness for analytics even in low-connectivity areas. No data loss due to network issues.

#### 4.4.3 Duplicate Detection & Prevention
Advanced duplicate detection prevents multiple scans per day per employee.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Pre-save Middleware in Attendance Model
attendanceSchema.index({ employeeId: 1, scanDate: 1 }, { unique: true });

attendanceSchema.statics.checkDuplicateScan = async function(employeeId, scanDate) {
  const startOfDay = new Date(scanDate);
  startOfDay.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  
  const endOfDay = new Date(scanDate);
  endOfDay.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
  
  return await this.findOne({
    employeeId: employeeId,
    scanTime: { $gte: startOfDay, $lte: endOfDay },
    isValidScan: true
  });
};
```

#### 4.4.4 Intelligent Time Window Analysis
Automatic calculation of arrival status based on configured work hours.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Pre-save middleware calculates time window
attendanceSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  const scanHour = this.scanTime.getHours();
  const scanMinute = this.scanTime.getMinutes();
  const totalMinutes = scanHour * 60 + scanMinute;
  
  const workStartTime = 9 * 60; // 9:00 AM
  
  if (totalMinutes < workStartTime - 30) {
    this.timeWindow = 'early';
    this.status = 'present';
  } else if (totalMinutes <= workStartTime + 5) {
    this.timeWindow = 'on_time';
    this.status = 'present';
  } else if (totalMinutes <= workStartTime + 15) {
    this.timeWindow = 'late';
    this.status = 'late';
    this.minutesLate = totalMinutes - workStartTime;
  } else {
    this.timeWindow = 'very_late';
    this.status = 'late';
    this.minutesLate = totalMinutes - workStartTime;
  }
  
  next();
});
```

#### 4.4.5 Automated Notification System
Email notifications sent automatically to emergency contacts for absentees.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Nodemailer Configuration
const sendAbsenteeNotification = async (employee, date) => {
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,
    port: process.env.SMTP_PORT,
    secure: true,
    auth: {
      user: process.env.SMTP_USER,
      pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS
    }
  });
  
  const mailOptions = {
    from: process.env.SMTP_FROM,
    to: employee.emergencyContactEmail,
    subject: `Absence Notification - ${employee.fullName}`,
    html: `
      <h2>Absence Alert</h2>
      <p>This is to inform you that ${employee.fullName} 
         (Employee ID: ${employee.employeeId}) was absent on ${date}.</p>
      <p>Department: ${employee.department}</p>
      <p>Please contact the employee if this absence was unplanned.</p>
    `
  };
  
  await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);
};
```

#### 4.4.6 Real-time Dashboard Updates
Socket.io enables live updates without page refresh.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Server-side Socket.io
const io = require('socket.io')(server);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('Admin connected');
  
  socket.on('subscribe-dashboard', () => {
    socket.join('dashboard-updates');
  });
});

// Emit on new attendance scan
app.post('/api/attendance/scan', async (req, res) => {
  const attendance = await Attendance.create(req.body);
  
  // Broadcast to all connected dashboards
  io.to('dashboard-updates').emit('new-attendance', {
    employee: attendance.employeeId,
    status: attendance.status,
    time: attendance.scanTime
  });
  
  res.json(attendance);
});
```

#### 4.4.7 Comprehensive Data Export
CSV export for external analysis and reporting.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const exportAttendanceCSV = async (startDate, endDate) => {
  const attendance = await Attendance.find({
    scanDate: { $gte: startDate, $lte: endDate }
  }).populate('employeeId', 'firstName lastName employeeId department');
  
  const csv = attendance.map(record => ({
    'Employee ID': record.employeeId.employeeId,
    'Name': `${record.employeeId.firstName} ${record.employeeId.lastName}`,
    'Department': record.employeeId.department,
    'Date': record.scanDate.toLocaleDateString(),
    'Time': record.scanTime.toLocaleTimeString(),
    'Status': record.status,
    'Minutes Late': record.minutesLate,
    'Location': record.location
  }));
  
  return convertToCSV(csv);
};
```

### 4.5 Data Flow
The data flow process ensures efficient and secure attendance tracking through a well-orchestrated pipeline:

**Detailed Data Flow Process:**

1. **QR Code Generation (Admin Portal):**
   - Admin generates unique QR code for employee via `/api/employees/:id/qr`
   - QR code contains encrypted employee data (ID, name, department, position)
   - QR code stored in database with security hash and expiration date
   - QR code embedded in printable ID card

2. **QR Code Scanning (Mobile App/Web Scanner):**
   - Scanner (mobile or web) captures QR code using camera
   - App extracts JSON data from QR code
   - Local timestamp, device info, and geolocation captured
   - Data structure:
   ```javascript
   {
     qrCode: "encrypted_qr_string",
     location: "Main Office",
     geoLocation: { latitude: -17.8252, longitude: 31.0335 },
     deviceInfo: { platform: "Android", userAgent: "...", ipAddress: "..." },
     notes: "Optional notes"
   }
   ```

3. **Local Storage (Offline Mode):**
   - If no internet connection detected by NetInfo
   - Data stored in AsyncStorage (mobile) or LocalStorage (web)
   - Timestamp and sync status recorded
   - Queue created for pending uploads

4. **Data Transmission (API Request):**
   - POST request to `/api/attendance/scan` with JWT token in header
   - Request includes all captured data plus authentication token
   - HTTPS encryption ensures secure transmission
   - Retry mechanism for failed requests

5. **Backend Validation (Server-Side Processing):**
   ```javascript
   // QR Code Parsing and Validation
   const qrResult = QRService.parseQRCode(qrCode);
   if (!qrResult.isValid) {
     return error('Invalid QR code');
   }
   
   // Employee Verification
   const employee = await Employee.findOne({ 
     employeeId: qrResult.employeeId,
     isActive: true 
   });
   
   // Duplicate Check
   const duplicate = await Attendance.checkDuplicateScan(
     employee._id, 
     new Date()
   );
   if (duplicate) {
     return error('Already scanned today');
   }
   
   // Time Window Calculation
   const timeWindow = calculateTimeWindow(scanTime);
   const minutesLate = calculateLateness(scanTime);
   ```

6. **Data Storage (MongoDB):**
   - Validated attendance record saved to MongoDB
   - Employee attendance statistics automatically updated
   - Indexes ensure fast querying
   - Timestamps recorded for audit trail

7. **Real-time Updates (Socket.io):**
   - WebSocket event emitted to connected admin dashboards
   - Live dashboard updates without page refresh
   - Real-time attendance count updates

8. **Notification Processing:**
   - Check if notification needed (late arrival, absence)
   - Queue email to emergency contact
   - Log notification status
   - Track delivery confirmation

9. **Admin Access (Dashboard):**
   - Admin retrieves data via GET `/api/attendance` routes
   - Filters applied (date range, department, status)
   - Data visualized in charts and tables
   - Export to CSV for external analysis

#### 6.2.2 Integration Testing: Harmonizing "AttendPro" System Modules
Integration testing verified seamless interactions between the system's components, including the mobile app, backend server, MongoDB database, and admin portal. Key interactions tested included:
- QR Code Scanning to Data Storage: Ensured data from QR code scans was correctly sent to the backend, validated, and stored in MongoDB.
- Real-Time Updates: Confirmed that Socket.io events updated the admin dashboard instantly after attendance events.
- API Communication: Validated RESTful API calls between the mobile app, backend, and admin portal.

Testing was primarily conducted in controlled environments with HTTPS enabled, as mobile QR code scanning required secure connections.
