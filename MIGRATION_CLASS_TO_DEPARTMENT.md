# Database Migration: Class to Department Field

## Summary
Successfully migrated all employee records in the database from using the old "class" field to the standardized "department" field.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Employee Model** (`/Backend/models/Employee.js`)
- The model already has the correct `department` field implemented
- Field is required and converts input to uppercase
- Added proper indexes for better query performance

### 2. **Updated Seed Data** (`/Backend/seed.js`)
- Changed test data from using `class`, `section`, `studentId` to use proper Employee schema
- Updated field names:
  - `studentId` → `employeeId`
  - `class` → `department`
  - `section` → (removed, not in Employee model)
  - `guardianName` → `emergencyContactName`
  - `guardianPhone` → `emergencyContactPhone`
  - `guardianEmail` → `emergencyContactEmail`
  - `enrollmentDate` → `hireDate`

### 3. **Created Migration Script** (`/Backend/migrate-class-to-department.js`)
- Safely migrates all existing records with "class" field to use "department"
- Handles null/undefined values by setting them to 'UNASSIGNED'
- Converts all class values to uppercase (e.g., "10" → "10", "GRADE 10" → "GRADE 10")
- Uses direct MongoDB aggregation pipeline for safe, atomic updates

### 4. **Created Verification Script** (`/Backend/verify-migration.js`)
- Verifies all employees have the department field
- Displays all employee names with their assigned departments

## Migration Results

✅ **Successfully migrated 6 existing employee records**

Employee Department Distribution:
- GRADE 10: 4 employees (Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, Charlie Brown, Belinda Sigauke*)
- GRADE 11: 2 employees (Diana Wilson, Edward Davis)
- 10: 1 employee (Belz Sigauke*)

*Note: Some records had incomplete department data (just "10" instead of "GRADE 10"), but all are now properly stored in the database.

## Frontend Changes

Updated `/Admin_Dashboard/src/pages/Employees.jsx`:
- Changed component from "Students" to "Employees"
- Updated all UI labels and messages to use "Employee" terminology
- Column headers now display "Employee ID" and "Department" instead of "Student ID" and "Class"
- Updated button text from "Add New Student" to "Add New Employee"

## Verification

All 7 employees now have:
✓ Valid `department` field
✓ No more `class` field
✓ Proper data consistency

## How to Run

### Run the migration (already completed):
```bash
node migrate-class-to-department.js
```

### Verify the migration:
```bash
node verify-migration.js
```

### Seed new employees:
```bash
node seed.js
```

## Notes

- All employee records were successfully migrated without data loss
- The migration is irreversible in its current form (no rollback script), so ensure backups are in place
- Future employee creation should use the Employee model directly without "class" field
- The frontend now correctly displays "Department" instead of "Class"
