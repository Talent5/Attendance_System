Chapter 1: Introduction to the "AttendPro" QR Code-Based Workplace Attendance System
1.1 Introduction
The Ministry of ICT, Innovation, Postal and Courier Services in Zimbabwe is the central authority responsible for formulating and implementing national policies on information and communication technologies (ICTs), postal services, and innovation. Its mandate includes driving digital transformation to modernize public sector operations and integrate emerging technologies across the economy (Ministry of ICT, Innovation, Postal and Courier Services, 2023). Internally, the Ministry must exemplify the digital efficiency it promotes, making the optimization of its operational processes both symbolic and functional. However, during my internship, I observed that the Ministry's employee attendance system relied on outdated, paper-based methods, which were inefficient and prone to errors. This observation aligns with broader challenges in Zimbabwe's public sector, where digital transformation potential remains underutilized despite advancements in digital payments (World Bank, 2021).
To address this gap, I contributed to the development of the "AttendPro" QR Code-Based Workplace Attendance System. This project aimed to replace manual attendance registers with a digital solution leveraging QR code technology to streamline tracking, enhance accuracy, and align with the Ministry's digital transformation goals. The system draws inspiration from similar QR code-based attendance systems in academic literature, which have demonstrated improved efficiency in educational settings (Masalha & Hirzallah, 2014; Patel et al., 2019). The internship provided hands-on experience in applying data science and informatics to solve real-world challenges, contributing to both organizational efficiency and academic discourse on public sector digitalization.

7.6 Concluding Remarks
The "AttendPro" QR Code-Based Workplace Attendance System represents a significant step toward modernizing attendance management at Zimbabwe's Ministry of ICT. Despite limitations, such as the lack of offline functionality and mobile testing constraints, the project demonstrates the potential of QR code technology to improve efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in public sector operations. The application of data science and informatics principles, including structured data collection, real-time analytics via dashboards, and the potential for predictive modeling, fulfills the academic requirements for a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Data Science and Informatics. The project's insights into technical challenges (e.g., HTTPS constraints) and environmental barriers (e.g., connectivity issues) provide a foundation for future ICT initiatives in Zimbabwe, aligning with national e-governance goals (United Nations, 2018). With further development to address offline functionality and advanced security features, and strategic deployment through phased rollouts and user training, the "AttendPro" system can serve as a model for digital transformation across Africa, contributing to sustainable, data-driven public sector solutions.
